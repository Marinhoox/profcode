    <h3>Cartoon - On & On</h3>
    <p>Hold me close 'til I get up
        Time is barely on our side
        I don't wanna waste what's left
        The storms we chase are leading us
        And love is all we'll ever trust, yeah
        No, I don't wanna waste what's left
        And on and on we'll go
        Through the wastelands, through the highways
        'Til my shadow turns to sun rays
        And on and on we'll go
        Through the wastelands, through the highways
        And on and on we'll go
        Oh, on we'll go
        Finding life along the way
        Melodies we haven't played
        No, I don't want no rest
        Echoin' around these walls
        Fighting to create a song (yeah)
        I don't wanna miss a beat
        And on and on we'll go
        Through the wastelands, through the highways
        'Til my shadow turns to sun rays
        And on and on we'll go
        Through the wastelands, through the highways
        And on and on we'll go
        And we'll grow in number
        Fueled by thunder, see the horizon
        Turn us to thousands
        And we'll grow in number
        Fueld by thunder, see the horizon
        Turn us to thousands
        And on and on we'll go
        Through the wastelands, through the highways
        'Til my shadow turns to sun rays
        And on and on we'll go
        Through the wastelands, through the highways
        And on and on we'll go</p>

        <h3>Defqwop - Heart Afire</h3>
        <p>Nightmares creep while you and me repeat
            This bittersweet heat is suffocating
            I'm waiting, and always hesitating
            Kryptonite desires set my heart afire
            Heart on fire, set my heart afire, yeah
            With crimson secrets and forbidden bliss
            Can't stay still, don't stop the thrill
            My bones crave your skin, temptation within
            Mistakes ignite the silence
            Nightmares creep while you and me repeat
            This bittersweet heat is suffocating
            I'm waiting, and always hesitating
            Kryptonite desires set my heart afire
            Heart on fire, set my heart afire, yeah
            Connect the dots straight to the start of intoxicating want
            Lingering touch, these soft words whispered in the dark
            Set my heart afire
        </p>
